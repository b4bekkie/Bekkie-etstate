# Real Estate Project

## Overview

Welcome to our modern real estate platform built using a stack of cutting-edge technologies. We've designed this platform to offer a seamless property buying and renting experience. Below are some of the key features, technologies used, and how to get in touch with us.

## Features

### 1. Contact Landlord via WhatsApp

- Users can easily connect with landlords or property owners through WhatsApp. A dedicated chat button allows users to initiate a conversation with the landlord, making the communication process convenient.

### 2. Property Location via React-leaflet Map

- Property listings include integrated React-leadlet openstreet Map to display the exact location of each property. Users can explore the neighborhood, nearby amenities, and assess the property's surroundings.

### 3. Advanced Search Functionalities

- Our platform provides powerful search capabilities, including filtering, sorting, and advanced search criteria. Users can narrow down their property search based on factors like price, location, property type, and more.

### 4. Property Listing

- Users have the ability to post their properties for sale or rent. They can create detailed listings, add property descriptions, upload images, and set pricing information. This feature makes it easy for property owners to showcase their offerings to potential buyers or tenants.

### 5. Modern Authentication

- Our platform prioritizes user security and provides modern authentication mechanisms. Users can create accounts, sign in, and manage their profiles securely.

### 6. Google Authentication

- For added convenience, users can opt for Google Authentication. This allows them to sign in with their Google accounts, streamlining the registration and login process.
